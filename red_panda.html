                <td><p>The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, is a small mammal native to the
                    eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs,
                    white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. Its head-to-body length is 51–63.5 cm
                    (20.1–25.0 in) with a 28–48.5 cm (11.0–19.1 in) tail, and it weighs between 3.2 and 15 kg
                    (7.1 and 33.1 lb). It is well adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and curved
                    semi-retractile claws. </p>
                    <p>The red panda was first formally described in 1825. The two currently recognised subspecies,
                    the Himalayan and the Chinese red panda, genetically diverged about 250,000 years ago. The red
                    panda's place on the evolutionary tree has been debated, but modern genetic evidence places it
                    in close affinity with raccoons, weasels, and skunks. It is not closely related to the giant
                    panda, which is a bear, though both possess elongated wrist bones or "false thumbs" used for
                    grasping bamboo. The evolutionary lineage of the red panda (Ailuridae) stretches back around 25
                    to 18 million years ago, as indicated by extinct fossil relatives found in Eurasia and North
                    America.</p></td>
