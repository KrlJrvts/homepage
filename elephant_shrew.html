                <td><p>Elephant shrews, also called jumping shrews or sengis, are small insectivorous mammals native
                    to Africa, belonging to the family Macroscelididae, in the order Macroscelidea.
                    Their traditional common English name "elephant shrew" comes from a perceived resemblance between
                    their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and their superficial similarity with shrews
                    (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. However, phylogenetic analysis has revealed that
                    elephant shrews are not properly classified with true shrews, but are in fact more closely related
                    to elephants than to shrews. In 1997, the biologist Jonathan Kingdon proposed that they instead
                    be called "sengis" (singular sengi),[5] a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa, and in
                    1998, they were classified into the new clade Afrotheria.</p>
                    <p> are widely distributed across the southern part of Africa, and although common nowhere,
                    can be found in almost any type of habitat, from the Namib Desert to boulder-strewn outcrops
                    in South Africa to thick forest. One species, the North African elephant shrew, remains in the
                    semi-arid, mountainous country in the far northwest of Africa. The Somali elephant shrew went
                    unobserved from 1968 to 2020 but was rediscovered by a group of scientists in Djibouti.
